Doge Monitor
============

This python script uses a Raspberry Pi and Adafruit 16x2 character LCD
to display interesting network stats about the Dogecoin network.

Based on sample code by PieMan2201 on reddit (thanks!), this script
cycles between 4 displays:
* Network difficulty and estimated hash rate (from dogechain.info)
* Total Dogecoins in existence (from dogechain.info)
* Current USD price (per 1k Doge) and 24hr change (from coinmarketcap.northpole.ro)
* Current BTC/Doge price in satoshi (from coinmarketcap.northpole.ro)

Display changes every 5 seconds, with network refreshes approx every 5 minutes
